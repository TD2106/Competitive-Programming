There are only two arrangements of the rectangles that can result in a square:

ABC
ABC
ABC

ABB
ACC
ACC

(Or rotated/reflected versions of these.)  We line up the edges of our
rectangles according to thse arrangements and see whether they actually form a
square.  If they do, great; if they do not, we know we can't possibly make a
square.
